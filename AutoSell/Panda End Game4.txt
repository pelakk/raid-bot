// Panda End Game rules for all uses (Battles, Inbox, Storage)

// Syntax explanation:
// Any blank line or line starting with // is ignored: allows adding comments
// Actions Keep or Sell or Upgrade 4,8,12,16 : mandatory at the beginning of the rule, defines the action to take if the rule is true
// Action Upgrade n upgrades the item to level n then the Bot reads new stats and apply all rules again to keep or sell upgraded item
// Optional keyword Artifact, Accessory or SpecialAcc after the action means that the rule is only for artifacts or accessories or special accessories
// Keyword GroupSets allows to define a group of sets to use in rules
// All other conditions are optional and can be placed in any order in the rule, separated by commas:
// - Set = : defines the Sets concerned by the rule (set names idem Raid), "Set = GroupSets" uses the group of sets defined by the last line "GroupSets = "
// - Type = : defines the types concerned, possible values = W, H, S, G, C, B, R, A, N, W = Weapon, H = Helmet, S = Shield, G = Gauntlet, C = Chestplate, B = Boots, R = Ring, A = Amulet, N = Banner
//	          Combo (W/H/S means considering artifacts of type Weapon, Helmet, or Shield)
// - Main = : defines the main stats concerned, possible values = ATK%, DEF%, HP%, CR%, CD%, ACC, RES, ATK, DEF, HP (e.g., ATK%/DEF%/HP% means the main Stat must be ATK% or DEF% or HP%)
// - Rank : in the form = or > or < or <= or >= (e.g., Rank < 6)
// - Level : in the form = or > or < or <= or >= (e.g., Level < 16)
// - Rarity : Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Mythic in the form = or > or < or <= or >= (e.g., Rarity < Epic means considering Common, Uncommon and Rare items)
// - Sub = : idem Main stats (maximum of 4 Sub conditions since there are up to 4 substats per item)
// - 2*Sub means that 2 substats of the item must meet the condition
// - Sub values = ATK%, DEF%, HP%, CR%, CD%, ACC, RES, ATK, DEF, HP. Sub value can be followed by 1, 2, 3, 4 e.g. SPD2 in rules means SPD(2) in Raid screen
