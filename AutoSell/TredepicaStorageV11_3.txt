// TredepicaStorage v11.3
// Storage filter for artifacts and accessories management
// ======================================================
// SYNTAX EXPLANATION
// ======================================================
// Any blank line or line starting with // is ignored: allows adding comments
// Actions Keep or Sell or Upgrade 4,8,12,16 : mandatory at the beginning of the rule
// Action Upgrade n upgrades the item to level n then Bot reads new stats and applies all rules again
// Optional keyword Artifact, Accessory or SpecialAcc after the action means rule is only for that type
// Keyword GroupSets allows to define a group of sets to use in rules

// All other conditions are optional and can be placed in any order, separated by commas:
// - Set = : defines the Sets concerned (set names as in Raid), "Set = GroupSets" uses the last defined group
// - Type = : W = Weapon, H = Helmet, S = Shield, G = Gauntlet, C = Chestplate, B = Boots, R = Ring, A = Amulet, N = Banner
//            Combo (W/H/S means Weapon, Helmet, or Shield)
// - Main = : main stats, values = ATK%, DEF%, HP%, CR%, CD%, ACC, RES, SPD, ATK, DEF, HP
//            (e.g., ATK%/DEF%/HP% means main stat must be ATK% or DEF% or HP%)
// - Rank : in form = or > or < or <= or >= (e.g., Rank < 6)
// - Level : in form = or > or < or <= or >= (e.g., Level < 16)
// - Rarity : Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Mythic in form = or > or < or <= or >=
//            (e.g., Rarity < Epic means Common, Uncommon and Rare items)
// - Sub = : substat conditions (max 4 Sub conditions per rule)
//           Values = ATK%, DEF%, HP%, CR%, CD%, ACC, RES, SPD, ATK, DEF, HP
//           Sub value can be followed by roll count 1,2,3,4 e.g. SPD2 means SPD(2) on Raid screen
//           2*Sub means 2 substats must meet the condition

// ======================================================
// FILTER LOGIC
// ======================================================
// DAMAGE/UNIVERSAL/DEBUFFER: SPD required
// TANK: SPD optional
// FERAL: Keep all (first rule - before any Sell!)

// ======================================================
// ACCESSORY SUBSTAT RESTRICTIONS
// ======================================================
// Ring substats: HP, HP%, ATK, ATK%, DEF, DEF% ONLY (NO SPD, CR%, CD%, ACC, RES)
// Amulet substats: HP, ATK, DEF (flat), ACC, RES, CD% ONLY (NO HP%, ATK%, DEF%, SPD, CR%)
// Banner substats: HP, HP%, ATK, ATK%, DEF, DEF%, SPD (NO ACC, RES, CR%, CD%)
